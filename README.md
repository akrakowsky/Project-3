## Introduction

  Ever look up into the night sky and for moment spot an unusual shape? NUFORC has captured the reported sightings of UFOs on their site and organized them by event date, shape, state and posted date. This site was first introduced in class as part of our Pandas training to fix the provided data and format the duration column. During class there was an interest in the locations of sightings. This project is diving deeper into that data and creating interactive visualizations.
